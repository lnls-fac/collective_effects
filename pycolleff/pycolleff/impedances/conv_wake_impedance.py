    [1] Mounet, N. (2012). The LHC Transverse Coupled-Bunch Instability.
        École Polytechinique Fédérale de Lausanne.

    This implementation assumes the impedance (Z) is calculated for positive
    values of angular frequencies (w) only. Simmetry properties of the
    impedances are used to account for the Fourier integral in negative
    frequencies.
    It also assumes the sampling of the impedance is well performed such that
    the cubic Hermite interpolation is a good approximation for the impedance.
    The function gives an option of returning the interpolation object used in
    the calculations (`ret_interp=True`), so that the user can check
    afterwards whether this assumption is True or not.

    Args:
        s (numpy.ndarray, (N, )): positions where to evaluate wake [m].
        w (numpy.ndarray, (M, )): angular frequencies where impedance is
            defined [rad/s]. I assume this vector only contains posivite
            frequencies.
        Z (numpy.ndarray, (M, )): Longitudinal or transverse impedance
            [Ohm or Ohm/m].
        plane (str, optional): type of the impedance. May assume values:
            'long' or 'trans'. Defaults to 'long'.
        interp_type (str, optional): Defines algorithm to be used for the
            calculations of dZ/dw for the integration. May assume values:
            'spline' or 'monotone' (see ref.[1] and scipy.interpolate help
            for more infos) . Defaults to 'spline'.
        ret_interp (bool, optional): Whether or not to also return the
            interpolation object used to calculate the derivatives of the
            impedance. Defaults to False.
        beta (float, optional): The particle's velocity in units of the speed
            of light. Detaults to 1.

    Raises:
        ValueError: when any angular frequency is negative.

    Returns:
        wake (numpy.ndarray, (N, )): wake at `s` positions behind the source.
        interp (CubicSpline or PchipInterpolator from scipy.interpolate,
